##Interests, Coupons and Yields

- **Credit Spread**: the part of interest that is inexcess of what would be charged in an identical risk free structure.

- **Credit Risk**: The risk that the borrower may not make contractual payments in full and on time.

For debt products with maturity more than one year, there is offered at least annual cash payments. While such a debt would be called a *loan* for a bank, their capital market counterparts are called *Bonds*.

**Bonds** are thus debt securities that promise the payment of some *principal amount* and *regular coupons*.

Many investors are incapable of coming up with the entire bond amount, thus the bond is usually split into many smaller bonds that can be distributed to further investors.

The splitting of a bond issue into smaller bonds is called the *primary market*. Selling these smaller bonds to other investors prior to maturity is called the *secondary market*.
