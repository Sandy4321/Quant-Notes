##Bonds

*Primary features of a Bond*

- **Face Value** `F` (usually 100/1000)
- **Coupon Rate** $\alpha$, pays $c = \alpha F/2$ every six months 
- **Maturity** `T`, Date of payment of Face value and the last coupon
- **Price** `P`
- **Quality Rating**, S&P Ratings AAA, AA, BBB, BB, CCC, CC.

An important but not entirely significant coglomarate of these variables is the *Yield factor* which can help compare different bonds.

**Yield to maturity, $\lambda$**

An expression used to evaluate $\lambda$ is, 

$$ P = \sum_{k=1}^{2T} \frac{c}{(1+\lambda/2)^k} + \frac{F}{(1+\lambda/2)^{2T}}$$ 

thus it is the effective annual interest rate at which P is the present value of the coupon payments.

- Thus, if a bond has a low price, it might have a high yield to maturity, thus effectively a lower quality (risk-wise)
